# cyberracing (WIP|on halt)

The development process on this project has been temporarily stopped. It will come back online when I get more time after finishing all the other university tasks.

4th computer graphics project

This is a simple game engine bundled with a demo written in JS + WebGL + HTML + CSS. Features Unity-like composite pattern.

Please note it is WIP. Exact to-do's are:
* fix lighting issues (math behind matrices and transformations)
* fix flat shader (sadly WebGL is the worst and has no option to turn off rendering pipeline interpolation)
